# Welcome to My Meal Planner App

### Project Description
Welcome to my meal planner web app repository! Having following the full stack development course by codecademy, I was tasked to complete this portfolio project which I was tasked to build a message generator program. Struggling to come out with ideas, I remember the constant struggle at home. My mum always struggles to find inspiration on what to cook for us throughtout the week, and I thought that it would be a good idea to come up with random meals ideas. If you do not ike the selection, you can always randomise the selection again. 

### Project Ideas
1. I would like to build a web application with simple html and css that contains a title, a brief description of the web app, and a generation button. Upon clicking of the button, it should trigger a JS script which will reveal the meal ideas for each day of the week. Each section should contain the day, the name of the meal, the ingredients of the meal, link to recommended recipes as well as an image of the meal. 

2. The data would be stored in arrays in a simple javascript file containing the following datas :
    - Name of Meal (String)
    - Description (String)
    - Link of Recipe (String)
    - Image of the Meal (URL)

3. Create a function that picks five meals at random, one for each day of the week, and sends them to the index.html section where it will display to the users.
